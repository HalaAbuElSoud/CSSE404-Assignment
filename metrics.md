## Metrics of Reliability

1. **Sensor Data Accuracy Rate**: Correct bin full levels are guaranteed by a minimum of 98% accuracy, allowing for dependable route optimisation and avoiding needless collections.

2. **System Downtime**: In order to prevent missed pickups, unlawful dumping, or environmental risks, the system must continue to operate. Reliable operation requires less than one hour of downtime per month.

## Justification

For route optimisation, SWMS depends on precise, up-to-date data. Any variation could lead to inefficiencies or waste overflowing. Reliability metrics guarantee compliance with environmental standards, cost savings, and continued service.
