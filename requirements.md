## The Functional Requirements

1. Every 15 minutes, the system will use Internet of Things sensors to gather fill-level data from smart garbage containers.
2. Using sensors data and geographical location, the system will automatically create the best garbage vehicle routes.  

## The Non-Functional Requirements

1. The system must react in less than two seconds to process and display sensor data on the dashboard.
2. To guarantee safe data transfer, TLS 1.3 encryption must be used for all communications between the sensors, the cloud server, and the mobile application.
