System Modelling with Threat Analysis - Smart Waste Management System

## Description of the System

An Internet of Things system called the Smart Waste Management System (SWMS) was created to keep an eye on public trash cans, streamline garbage collection routes, and encourage environmentally friendly waste management techniques. In order to estimate fill levels, it gathers data in real time from ultrasonic sensors installed in bins. It then transmits this data to a central computer for dashboard visualisation and route optimisation.

## Justification for Security & Dependability

System security and dependability are crucial because SWMS gathers, processes, and sends real-time data from several physical locations. Maintaining correct operations and public confidence in urban infrastructure requires ensuring secure data transfer, sensor data availability, and security against tampering or fraudulent inputs.
